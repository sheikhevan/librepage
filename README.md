****
LibrePage is a simple, yet feature-rich browser homepage.

## Installation

```bash
git clone https://github.com/sheikhevan/librepage
cd librepage
```

```bash
bun install
```

```bash
bun run dev
```

You can of course use another package manager, I just choose to use bun.

## Usage
Look up how to set the homepage and new tab page in your browser, then, set it to [librepage.xyz](https://librepage.xyz)
